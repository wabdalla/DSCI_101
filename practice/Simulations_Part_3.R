# Exercise 6: Calculate the probability of getting any side of any kind 
#             of dice. 
#             In order to achieve this, create a function such that the 
#             arguments are i, dice, and any outcome. 
#             This function should work for any dice, and tests for any 
#             outcome. 
#             Test your function with a dice that has 10 sides, 
#             and compute the probability of getting the side of 6. 
#             Compute experimental probability. 
#             Compare your experimental probability to the theoretical 
#             probability.
